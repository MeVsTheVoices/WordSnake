# WordSnake

This project was initially created for CS301 at CSUEB

It's primary contributors are Joshua Dunne and Lorenzo Campos

It uses wxWidgets, and has cross-language and cross-platform support

As this is now very much out of date and wxWidgets, despite cross platform support,
turned out to be cantankerous to use.

This works well, but its future is utterly limited because of what it uses
to present a reasonable UI to the user

As it is, it's archived, maybe someone will get some use out of it if they stubmleupon
